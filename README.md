#Scripts'n Snippets

This repository contains my scripts and code snippets.
Mostly setupscits atm, but lots of usefull small scripts for easy db access and
such is to be added. 

##Dusken Scripts
In the folder **dusken**
Scripts created in association with Under Dusken and Mediastud.

##Sustem setup script
Maybe not the most important of them, but definetlly one of the more usefull
ones. Just insert line into linux terminal to setup the local system environment to my liking.
